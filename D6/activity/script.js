// Step 1: Create an array called 'students' with three objects representing student information.
let students = [

    { name: 'Bob', age: 22, grade: 'B' },

  // Step 2: Access the name of the second student in the 'students' array and log it to the console.
  console.log(students[1].name); 
  
  // Step 3: Add a new student object to the 'students' array.
  students.push({ name: 'David', age: 21, grade: 'B+' });
  
  // Step 4: Loop through the 'students' array and log each student's name and grade to the console.
  students.forEach(student => {
    console.log(`Name: ${student.name}, Grade: ${student.grade}`);

  // Step 5: Create an object called 'book' with properties 'title', 'author', and 'year'.
  let book = {

  console.log(book.title); 
  
  // Step 7: Update the 'year' property of the 'book' object to 1930.
  book.year = 1930;
  
  // Step 8: Create a method called 'getSummary' for the 'book' object.
  book.getSummary = function() {
    return `${this.title} by ${this.author}, published in ${this.year}.`;
  };
  
  // Step 9: Call the 'getSummary' method of the 'book' object and log the result to the console.
  console.log(book.getSummary()); 
  
  // Step 10: Create an array called 'library' and add the 'book' object to it.
  let library = [book];
  
  // Step 11: Log the 'library' array to the console to verify the book is stored in the array.
  console.log(library);
  
  // Step 12: Create an object called 'car' with properties 'brand', 'model', and 'year'.
  let car = {
    brand: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Corolla',
    year: 2015
  };

  console.log(car.model); 
  
  // Step 14: Update the 'year' property of the 'car' object to 2023.
  car.year = 2023;
  
  // Step 15: Create a method called 'startEngine' for the 'car' object.
  car.startEngine = function() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model}'s engine is starting...`);
  };
  
  // Step 16: Call the 'startEngine' method of the 'car' object.
  car.startEngine(); 
  
  // Step 17: Create an array called 'garage' and add the 'car' object to it.
  let garage = [car];
  
  // Step 18: Log the 'garage' array to the console to verify the car is stored in the array.
  console.log(garage);
  
  // Step 19: Create an object called 'person' with properties 'name', 'age', and 'city'.
  let person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    city: 'New York'
  };
